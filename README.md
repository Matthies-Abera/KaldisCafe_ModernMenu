#  Kaldi's Cafe - Modern Menu

## My Goal

The goal of this project is to build my knowledge of Swift and Xcode through the first hand experience of creating my first fully developed application. In addition, agile software development will be conducted through the scrum framework.

## What I will create

In this app, I will be creating a simple Point Of Sale (POS) application whereby the owners and workers at Kaldi's Cafe can take orders in a more efficient manner as well as look back at previous orders in an analytical manner to make more informed decisions on resource allocation.

## Sprints Breakdown

The first version of this application will be split up into three separate sprints, all spanning for exactly two weeks each. 
Each sprint will focus on implementing one of the core aspects of the applicaiton:
* Sprint 1: Implementing the Menu Feature (24/08/2020 - 06/09/2020)
* Sprint 2: Implementing the Order Feature (7/09/2020 - 20/09/2020)
* Sprint 3: Implementing the Analytics Feature (21/08/2020 - 04/10/2020)
